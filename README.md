# Note-Taker

## Description
I created a server.js and added in npm packages like express and uuid. This will allow a user to input notes into the website and have it store to the left. In addition, when you click on a stored note it will then appear on the right to see. This is done through creating api paths. 
 ## Acceptance Criteria

 ```
 GIVEN a note-taking application
 WHEN I open the Note Taker
 THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
 WHEN I click on the link to the notes page
 THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
 WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text
 THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
 WHEN I click on the Save icon
